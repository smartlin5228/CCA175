Problem Scenario 93 : You have to run your Spark application with locally 8 thread or locally on 8 cores. Replace XXX with correct values.
spark-submit --class com.hadoopexam.MyTask XXX \ -deploy-mode cluster
SSPARK_HOME/lib/hadoopexam.jar 10


Explanation:
Solution
XXX: -master local[8]
Notes : The master URL passed to Spark can be in one of the following formats:
Master URL Meaning
local Run Spark locally with one worker thread (i.e. no parallelism at all}.
local[K] Run Spark locally with K worker threads (ideally, set this to the number of cores on your machine).
local[*] Run Spark locally with as many worker threads as logical cores on your machine.
spark://HOST:PORT Connect to the given Spark standalone cluster master. The port must be whichever one your master is configured to use, which is 7077 by default.
mesos://HOST:PORT Connect to the given Mesos cluster. The port must be whichever one your is configured to use, which is 5050 by default. Or, for a Mesos cluster using
ZooKeeper, use mesos://zk://.... To submit with --deploy-mode cluster, the HOST:PORT should be configured to connect to the MesosClusterDispatcher.
yarn Connect to a YARN cluster in client or cluster mode depending on the value of - deploy-mode. The cluster location will be found based on the HADOOP CONF DIR or
YARN CONF DIR variable.
