The core of Apache Hadoop consists of a storage part known as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and a processing part called MapReduce. Hadoop splits files into large blocks and distributes them across nodes in a cluster. To process data, Hadoop transfers packaged code for nodes to process in parallel based on the data that needs to be processed.
